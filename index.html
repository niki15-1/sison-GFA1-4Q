            <h1>What is it about?</h1>
            <p> The charity organization that I support, CAMELEON association, with a motto of “Changing colors. Changing Lives”, is a non-profit humanitarian organization. I support this organization because it is all about protecting and helping sexually abused girls in Western Visayas. They also serve as a place of safety for abused children and help them restore their lives and build a future. However, their primary goal—to assist in the rehabilitation of abused children who cannot afford it—is the major reason I support them. I respect this since I am aware that there are a lot of issues regarding having experienced trauma as a child and not being able to get treatment for it due to a lack of support and money. The main office of this organization is located at <b>Brgy. Sablogon, Passi City, Iloilo and its extension office is at 15-B del Carmen St., Jaro, Iloilo City.</p>
